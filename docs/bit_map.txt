Efficient representation of cards using a Bitmap 

Setup:
    Let a deck of cards be a binary vector of size 52 where a 1 at a_i represents if card a_i is present.  
    We can now represent this binary vector as an integer, effectively compressing an array into an integer.


Benefits:
    - Increased efficiency in looking up (will be important when computing game trees)
